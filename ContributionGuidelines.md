# Contribution Guidelines

#### Submissions:
* Fork the repository and create a new branch. Commit to that branch, and submit a pull request when you're finished.
* Look over your code before you submit. Fix any errors. Follow the style guidelines; They're pretty basic. Let's just
keep everything clean.

#### Style:
* White space: One line to separate each method. One line to separate public and private variables. One line can be 
included to separate groups of variables when appropriate. One line to separate variables from methods. Nothing more.
Everything else is standard.
* Delete auto-generated method comments.
* Brackets Should be formatted as such:
````
void aName()
{
    // aMethod
}
````
* Factor out redundancy.
* Don't include any `Debug.Log()` commands.
